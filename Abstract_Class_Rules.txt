Why Abstract 			== Security Feature [copyright]
============			== Ensure a particular funcationality is implement by all Children

	1) if you don't want a particular class to be instantiated
	2) When it doesn't make sense to implement a method 
	
	Animal an = new Animal(); // cow, cat, dog......
	Car c = new Car(); // Nissan, .... 



Rules about abstract class 
==========================

A class with Abstract Methods should always be Abstract

A abstract class can never be instantiated 

A abstract class can have 0/more Abstract methods or 0/more non-abstract methods

A child class which extends abstract class should implement
all abstract methods inherited or should be declared abstract itself
